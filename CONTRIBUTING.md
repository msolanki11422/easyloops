git checkout main

# Merge upstream changes
git merge upstream/main

# Push updates to your fork
git push origin main
```

### Creating a Feature Branch

# Or for documentation
git checkout -b docs/documentation-update
```

### Branch Naming Conventions

- **Features**: `feature/feature-name`
- **Bug fixes**: `fix/bug-description`
- **Documentation**: `docs/documentation-topic`
- **Refactoring**: `refactor/component-name`
- **Tests**: `test/test-description`

### 4. Educational Content

**Adding New Programming Exercises:**

1. **Choose a Topic**: Select from our roadmap or propose new topics
2. **Create Exercise Structure**:
   ```
   public/questions/XXX-topic-name/
   ├── problem.md          # Problem description
   ├── solution.js         # Reference solution
   ├── testcases.json      # Test cases
   ├── hints.md            # Helpful hints
   └── explanation.md      # Detailed explanation
   ```

3. **Exercise Guidelines**:
   - Clear problem statement
   - Progressive difficulty
   - Multiple test cases
   - Comprehensive explanations
   - Language-agnostic when possible

## 📏 Coding Standards

### Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting:

```bash
# Check code style
npm run lint

# Fix auto-fixable issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format code
npm run format
```

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Define proper interfaces and types
- Avoid `any` type when possible
- Use meaningful variable names

```typescript
// ✅ Good
interface ProgrammingExercise {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
  topics: string[];
}

// ❌ Bad
interface Exercise {
  id: any;
  data: any;
}
```

### React/Next.js Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Follow Next.js best practices
- Use TypeScript for all components

```tsx
// ✅ Good
interface Props {
  exercise: ProgrammingExercise;
  onComplete: (result: boolean) => void;
}

const ExerciseCard: React.FC<Props> = ({ exercise, onComplete }) => {
  // Component implementation
};

// ❌ Bad
const ExerciseCard = (props: any) => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### File Organization

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/              # Reusable UI components
│   ├── forms/           # Form components
│   └── exercises/       # Exercise-specific components
├── hooks/               # Custom React hooks
├── utils/               # Utility functions
├── types/               # TypeScript type definitions
└── constants/           # Application constants
```

### Commit Message Guidelines

```bash
# Format
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
