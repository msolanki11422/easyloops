# Serialization/deserialization

## Problem Statement

TODO: Describe the problem.

## Input Format

The input consists of 1 line:
```
Line 1: placeholder input
```

## Test Cases
**Input (`input.txt`):**
```
placeholder
```

**Expected Output (`expected.txt`):**
```
placeholder
```

## How to Test Your Solution
1. Copy your template file: `cp templates/python_template.py solution.py`
2. Implement your solution in the `solve()` function
3. Test with: `cat input.txt | python solution.py > output.txt`
4. Compare: `diff output.txt expected.txt`
5. If `diff` shows nothing, your solution is correct! âœ…

## Learning Objectives
- Understand serialization and deserialization concepts
- Work with common formats such as JSON, XML, and binary
- Implement serialization functions for complex data structures
- Safely deserialize data and handle corrupted input
- Apply serialization for file storage and inter-process communication
- Consider versioning and compatibility for serialized data

## Implementation Guidelines
### Python Example Structure:
```python
def solve():
    pass
```

### Go Example Structure:
```go
func solve() {
}
```

## Constraints
- TODO
