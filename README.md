## 📱 Deployment

The project is configured for easy deployment on multiple platforms:

### Firebase (Production)

```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

### Vercel (Alternative)

```bash
npm run build
# Connect to Vercel for automatic deployments
```

### Docker (Self-hosted)

```bash
docker build -t easyloops-react .
docker run -p 3000:3000 easyloops-react
```

### macOS Desktop App (Tauri)

The project includes a Tauri configuration for a native desktop build.

#### Prerequisites for Tauri Development

1. **Install Rust and Cargo** (Rust's package manager):

   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
   source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
   ```

2. **Verify installation**:

   ```bash
   rustc --version
   cargo --version
   rustup --version
   ```

3. **Install Xcode Command Line Tools** (macOS only):
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```

#### Running the Tauri App

```bash
npm run tauri:dev   # run the desktop app in development
npm run tauri:build # build a `.app` bundle
```

**Note**: The first run may take several minutes as it downloads and compiles Rust dependencies.
